One rainy morning, Emma missed her usual bus to work. Frustrated, she decided to walk instead. As she crossed the park, she noticed an old man struggling with his umbrella. She stopped, helped him, and shared a laugh. The man thanked her warmly and told her, “Sometimes, delays lead to better paths.” Surprised, Emma continued walking and discovered a small café she had never seen before. Curious, she entered. The aroma of fresh coffee and baked bread lifted her spirits. From that day on, Emma chose to walk through the park every morning, grateful for the missed bus.
